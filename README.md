## Traffic-Management-using-ML

#Overview

This project is a Traffic Management System that employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image analysis, a Computer Vision library for extracting frames from video, and a user-friendly frontend built with HTML, CSS, and React.js. SQL is used for database management.

#Features

Traffic Analysis: Utilizes a CNN model to analyze traffic images and make predictions.
Computer Vision: Extracts frames from video feeds for analysis.
User Interface: Provides an interactive frontend built with React.js for users to view and manage traffic data.
Database Management: Uses SQL for storing and retrieving traffic-related information.

#Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

TensorFlow
Computer Vision Library
React.js
SQL Database

#Configure CNN model:

Customize the CNN model in the model.py file to suit your traffic analysis requirements.

#Customization

Feel free to customize the application based on your requirements. You can modify the CNN model architecture, improve the Computer Vision algorithms, or enhance the React.js frontend.

#Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section in the documentation for solutions.
